# Image-Object-Detection-and-Annotation-Using-YOLOv8-CNN
“This project uses YOLOv8, a CNN-based deep learning model, to automatically detect and label objects in images. It draws bounding boxes with class names and confidence scores, processes multiple images in a folder, and saves annotated outputs, providing a beginner-friendly demonstration of computer vision and object detection.”
