# Image Object Detection and Annotation Using YOLOv8 (CNN)

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates **advanced image object detection and annotation** using **YOLOv8**, a state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The system detects multiple objects in images, draws precise bounding boxes, labels each detected object with its class and confidence score, and saves annotated images for review and analysis.

This implementation is designed to be **efficient, beginner-friendly, and easily extendable**, making it ideal for students, researchers, and developers learning computer vision techniques.

## Key Features
- **Accurate Multi-Object Detection:** Detects people, vehicles, animals, and more in images.  
- **Automatic Annotation:** Draws bounding boxes with labels and confidence scores.  
- **Batch Processing:** Processes multiple images from a folder in a single run.  
- **Output Management:** Annotated images are saved in a separate output folder for easy reference.  
- **Lightweight & Fast:** Uses YOLOv8 nano model (`yolov8n.pt`) for rapid inference.
